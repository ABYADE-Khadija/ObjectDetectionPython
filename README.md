# ObjectDetection
Realtimt Object detection using Python


The application is dedicated to object detection using the YOLO neural network as well as image processing via the OpenCv library based on the MsCOCO DataSet

  - Python Tiknter for user Interface

  - OpenCV for image processing  

  - Tensorflow for developing and running ML and DL applications.

   - MsCOCO DataSet for model training and testing.

   - YOLO V3 is one of the fastest real-time object detection algorithms
